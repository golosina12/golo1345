<p>
    !Bang commands perform your searches directly on other search engines.
    Sometimes you know you want to go directly to another site to search, and
    these commands save you steps in doing so.<br /><br />
    For example, suppose you wanted to search Amazon.com for 'bags'. In that case,
    you could just enter '!a bags' into DuckDuckGo and we'll take you right to the
    correct search results page on Amazon.com.<br /><br />
    If you've adjusted your region in the
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">Settings</a> menu, your !bangs will
    automatically direct you to the site for that region, if available. For
    example, if Germany is selected in the Settings, then !amazon will go to
    amazon.de.<br /><br />
