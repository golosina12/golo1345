We follow DMARC industry standards to authenticate messages sent through our Email Protection service so we can let you know if a message's sender is unverified.

Emails from unverified senders might be forgeries trying to impersonate people or companies. These emails may be attempts to steal personal or financial information from you. If you don’t know or recognize the sender, and if you see that a sender identity wasn’t verified, avoid clicking links or downloading attachments in those emails.
