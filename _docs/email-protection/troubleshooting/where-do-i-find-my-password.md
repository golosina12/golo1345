Email Protection is a forwarding service that works with your existing email account and inbox. There is no account password. Instead of using a traditional account password, Email Protection uses One-Time Passphrases for account sign-in. Whenever you need to sign in to your Email Protection account, we’ll send you an email with a One-Time Passphrase that you’ll need to enter in the same browser you’re trying to sign in from.
