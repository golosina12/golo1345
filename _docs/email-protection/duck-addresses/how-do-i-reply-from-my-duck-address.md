For most Duck Addresses, replies just work. Simply reply to any email sent to one of your Duck Addresses as you normally would. We route your replies through duck.com so they're delivered from the Duck Address they were sent to. If your forwarding address is on a unique domain without an [SPF record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/), replies sent from Duck Addresses aren't supported.
