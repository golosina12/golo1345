Private Duck Addresses are unique duck.com addresses that are automatically generated for you (example: avtzqdr@duck.com). Private Duck Addresses are great for situations where you do not want to share your personal Duck Address, such as when making online purchases or signing up for a newsletter.

Private Duck Addresses provide an extra layer of privacy by making it difficult for tracking companies to identify you based on your email address. They can also be deactivated individually, so if you ever start receiving unwanted email or spam to one of your private Duck Addresses, all you have to do is deactivate it.
