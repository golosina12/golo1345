DuckDuckGo browsers and browser extensions automatically detect email fields and make it easy to automatically autofill forms with your personal Duck Address or randomly generated private Duck Addresses. You can also generate private Duck Addresses on demand via the main menu in our apps and extensions, or on the “Autofill” tab of [Email Protection Settings](https://duckduckgo.com/email/settings/autofill).
