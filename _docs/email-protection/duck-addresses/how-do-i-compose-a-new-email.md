The easiest way to send from your personal Duck Address is to reply to a message sent to it. This will work automatically, and we suggest this method.

We hope to make starting a new thread with your personal Duck Address easier in the future, but for now you can do so by sending a message from your current Email Protection forwarding address using a special recipient address format.

For example, if your personal Duck Address is jane@duck.com and you want to send to your friend’s email brian@gmail.com. To send the email from your personal Duck Address, you would send the message to brian_at_gmail.com_jane@duck.com.

Note that there is only one ‘@’ symbol in the address (as is required); the @gmail has been replaced with \_at_gmail and your personal username has been appended after that, all followed by ‘@duck.com’. If you do this, then the email will go through us and then replies will work as normal thereafter without having to do anything more.
