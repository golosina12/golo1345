## How to Choose the Best VPN

Want to choose the best VPN for your needs? There are a few factors to consider. Some of the most common are price; number and location of servers offered; data caps; and the provider’s reputation and privacy practices.

We dig into each of these factors below.

### VPN Pricing and Subscription Model

VPN services typically offer varied pricing. When selecting the best VPN for your needs, it's crucial to balance affordability with the quality of the service. This helps to ensure your online privacy and security needs are met without compromise.

Opting for a longer commitment can unlock savings. Before making that investment in your digital safety, just be sure to confirm that your chosen VPN delivers the speed and security you’re looking for. You’ll also want to check that it’s compatible with all your devices.

### Are Free VPNs Worth It?

When you start looking for a VPN, one of the first things you’ll notice is that there are a lot of choices, both free and paid. It’s worth remembering that picking a VPNs is akin to making any purchase — [you get what you pay for](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/free-versus-paid-vpns-what-you-need-to-know/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

The best VPN providers have strong privacy policies and security practices. Some of these legitimate services do offer both free and paid tiers. The paid versions are often more robust than their free counterparts, offering higher data limits, access to servers near you, and so on.

Some free or low-quality VPNs, on the other hand, carry more risks than just slow connection speeds. Trustworthy VPN providers usually have a no-logging policy, meaning they don’t store any information about your online activities. This is not the case with less reputable companies, who may sell your personal information to third parties. As with any software, it’s good to review the privacy policy and user agreement before signing up.

### VPN Data Caps or Allowances

Data caps limit the amount of data you can send through VPN servers every month. These caps can make a big difference when you choose a VPN, especially if your online activities demand a lot of data, like gaming or streaming.

When shopping for a VPN, look for one that combines both speed with reliability. If you want to avoid data limitations altogether, consider a VPN that offers unlimited bandwidth, ensuring your internet usage remains uninterrupted and secure.

### VPN Servers and Locations

The number of servers and server locations offered by your VPN can have a big impact on day-to-day performance. Connecting to a server near you is generally faster than connecting to one far away, for example.

High-quality VPNs have plenty of servers in multiple countries, so you can get the fastest possible connection speed wherever you are.

### Reputation of the VPN Provider

You should always investigate a VPN provider's reputation before signing up. By necessity, all your internet traffic and data passes through your VPN, so you want to make sure you're not opening yourself up to more risk. Looking at a combination of user reviews and expert opinions can be helpful. Don’t forget to check the company’s history for any data breaches or privacy issues.

Trustworthy VPN providers are transparent about their privacy policies, security practices, and logging activities. That transparency can signal a commitment to user privacy and data protection.

At DuckDuckGo, for example, we don’t track you – that’s our [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) in a nutshell. And our VPN is [no exception](https://duckduckgo.com/pro/privacy-terms)! Fast, secure, and anonymous, the DuckDuckGo VPN is included in [Privacy Pro](http://duckduckgo.com/pro), our 3-in-1 privacy subscription service.

Take extra care when vetting free VPN services. You’ll want to know whether you’re dealing with a trusted provider that offers a free tier of service, or a less reputable company that makes money by selling anonymized user data, which is usually the data you’re trying to protect.

### VPN Privacy Policy

It's crucial to review VPN privacy policies thoroughly before signing up. You’ll want to understand if providers collect and use data, especially if they share it with third parties. The best VPN options maintain a stringent no-logging policy, guaranteeing that your online activity isn’t tracked or stored.

A transparent privacy policy will explain how the VPN safeguards your personal information. This information is critical to review if you want to be sure that your data will be protected and managed according to your needs.
