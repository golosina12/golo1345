## How do I enable Sync & Backup?

If you’re syncing two devices:

1. Make sure you have the DuckDuckGo browser installed on both devices
1. Open the DuckDuckGo browser on each device
1. Go to **Settings** > **Sync & Backup**
1. Select **Sync With Another Device**
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect the two devices. If you’re syncing a phone or tablet and a computer:
    - You can use the mobile device to scan the QR code displayed on the computer
    - Otherwise, you can manually enter a code

## Does it cost money to use Sync & Backup?

No, it’s a free feature of the DuckDuckGo browser.

    - Desktop: select **Enter Code**
    - Mobile: select **Manually Enter Code**
