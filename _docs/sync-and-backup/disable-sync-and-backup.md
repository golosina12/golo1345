## How do I turn off Sync & Backup on one of my devices?

You can think of this as “signing out” on one of your devices. Your synced data will remain on our server, and any other devices using Sync & Backup will not be affected. No data will be deleted locally.

To turn off Sync & Backup on one of your devices:

1. Open the DuckDuckGo browser
1. Go to **Settings** > **Sync & Backup**
1. Select **Turn Off Sync & Backup...**
1. Confirm your choice when prompted

## How do I turn off Sync & Backup for good and delete all data on the server?

To stop using Sync & Backup entirely:

1. Open the DuckDuckGo browser
1. Go to **Settings** > **Sync & Backup**
1. Select **Turn Off Sync and Delete Server Data...**
1. Confirm your choice when prompted

This will delete all your encrypted data from the DuckDuckGo server and will turn off Sync & Backup on all your synced devices. Your local data will not be deleted.
