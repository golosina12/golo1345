App Tracking Protection is a feature in the [DuckDuckGo Private Browser for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android) that helps block 3rd-party trackers in your apps, even when you’re not using them. When App Tracking Protection is enabled, it will detect when other apps on your phone are about to send data to any of the 3rd-party tracking companies in our [list of app trackers](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-blocklists/blob/main/app/README.md), and block most of those requests.

You can get DuckDuckGo App Tracking Protection by installing our DuckDuckGo Private Browser Android app and then going to App Tracking Protection in the ‘More from DuckDuckGo’ section of settings.
