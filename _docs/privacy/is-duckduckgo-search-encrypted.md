Yes, [DuckDuckGo Search](https://duckduckgo.com/) is always encrypted, and you can tell by looking at the web address in your browser. If the web address starts with “https” (instead of just “http”) that means it is encrypted and that no one in between you and us (including your internet provider and ours) can see your search terms.
