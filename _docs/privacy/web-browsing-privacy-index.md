DuckDuckGo never tracks you. And when you leave our search engine and use <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-duckduckgo/does-duckduckgo-make-a-browser/">our browsers</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser/">extensions</a> to browse other sites, we aim to protect your privacy as much as possible with multiple layers of privacy protections that are continually evolving to keep up with new tracking methods. Other browsers offer some of these by default, like cookie and fingerprinting protections, but we also provide many other protections that most browsers do not offer by default, like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection">3rd-party Tracker Loading Protection</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#global-privacy-control-gpc">Global Privacy Control</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#link-tracking-protection">Link Tracking Protection</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#cname-cloaking-protection">CNAME Cloaking Protection</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#google-amp-protection">Google AMP Protection</a>, and more, which all help cover different tracking angles.
