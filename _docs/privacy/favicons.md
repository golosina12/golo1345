Within [DuckDuckGo Search](https://duckduckgo.com) we show favicons (small website logos) for a better user experience. These favicons are requested from our servers rather than from websites directly, because it can be surprisingly complicated to locate a favicon for a website — they can be stored in a variety of locations and in a variety of formats. We've developed our behind-the-scenes service to understand these edge cases and simplify retrieval within our search engine.

At DuckDuckGo, we don’t track you, ever. That’s our [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) in a nutshell. For example, we do not create unique cookies and, more generally, architect our product so that we do not even have the ability to create a search or browsing history for any individual — it’s privacy by design.

Updates to favicons should occur automatically over a period of a few weeks. If you are seeing a persistent problem, please [let us know](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/contact-us/).
