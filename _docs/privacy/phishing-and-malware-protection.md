The DuckDuckGo browser’s phishing and malware protection help keep you safe while browsing online. It works by checking the sites you visit against a list of malicious websites stored on your device and warning you if you try to visit them.

## Why is phishing and malware protection necessary?

Phishing and malware are two of the most common online security threats. Cybercriminals use these tactics to trick users into providing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers, or downloading malware that can infect your phone or computer and cause damage or extract personal information. Phishing and malware protection is designed to alert you to sites that have been flagged for making phishing attempts or hosting malware.

## How does phishing and malware protection work in DuckDuckGo browsers?

Phishing and malware protection works by checking the sites you visit against lists of sites stored on your device that have been reported for phishing, unwanted software, and malware. If you attempt to visit a site on this list, you’ll first see a warning message that gives you the option to navigate away safely or continue to the site at your own risk.

## How does DuckDuckGo know if I’ve visited a malicious site without tracking my browsing activity?

We designed a private method of identifying when you visit a site flagged for phishing or malware that doesn't require us to see your browsing activity. Instead, our servers provide your browser with partial information (hash prefixes) of known malicious websites. Around 90% of the time, only this on-device data is used to identify a malicious site and display the warning message.

Occasionally, more information might be required, in which case the browser sends a very short, anonymized code (first 3-4 characters of the hash of the domain) to our servers which returns the necessary information for your browser to determine whether the site is malicious. This anonymized code contains no personal information and is deleted as soon as the necessary information is returned to your browser.
