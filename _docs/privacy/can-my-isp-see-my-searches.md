No. Because the connection between you and [DuckDuckGo Search](https://duckduckgo.com/) is encrypted, that means your internet provider cannot see the searches you make on DuckDuckGo.

You can check your connection is encrypted by looking at the web address in your browser. If the web address starts with “https” (instead of just “http”) that means it is encrypted. If you use our browser or browser extensions, our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#smarter-encryption-https-upgrading">Smarter Encryption feature</a> encrypts connections to more of the websites you visit, such as the ones you may click on from DuckDuckGo Search.
