## DuckDuckGo VPN (DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc.)

DuckDuckGo VPN is a transitory digital communications service, as defined by Section 512(a) of the U.S. Copyright Act. We cannot remove content upon notifications of claimed infringement because we do not store such material on our servers. In service of our privacy-focused mission, we do not keep logs of user activity so we are unable to tie online activity to a particular account.

We rely upon third-party complaints of infringement or other wrongdoing, and in our sole discretion, may conduct internal investigations in appropriate circumstances. We have a policy to terminate user access if we find users engaging in repeat infringement of copyright.

To file a complaint, send your notice to [netp-legal@duckduckgo.com](mailto:netp-legal@duckduckgo.com). Your email should include:

1. An identification of the copyrighted work(s) or trademark(s) that you claim have been infringed;
1. A description of the nature and location of the content that you claim to be infringing;
1. Identification of the user who you believe is responsible for the infringement;
1. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the rights holder, its agent, or the law; and
1. A statement that the information in your complaint is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rights holder or are authorized to act on their behalf.
