No. We are not and have never been owned by Google or any other entity. We have been an independent company since our founding in 2008. We also do not source any of our search results from Google. You may notice that we offer an extension for Google Chrome and Google Android app, but these are also not in partnership with Google and actually aim to protect you from Googleâ€™s online trackers.
