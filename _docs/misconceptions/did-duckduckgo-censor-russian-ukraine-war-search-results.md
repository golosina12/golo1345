No. Our search ranking is strictly non-political, meaning we don’t evaluate or otherwise take into account any potential political bias or leanings of websites in our search result rankings. For Russia in particular, a few sites identified by our news spam detector were from the Russian state, but we do not go looking for anything Russian in particular (or any particular country or topic). We also do not evaluate the "truth" of any particular news story or narrative. For more information, see our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/news-rankings/">news rankings</a> help page.
