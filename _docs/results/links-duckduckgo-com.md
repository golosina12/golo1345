At DuckDuckGo, we don’t track you, ever. That’s our [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) in a nutshell. For example, we do not create unique cookies and, more generally, architect our product so that we do not even have the ability to create a search or browsing history for any individual — it’s privacy by design.

When using [DuckDuckGo Search](https://duckduckgo.com), you may notice network requests to links.duckduckgo.com. For stability, privacy, and security we compartmentalize parts of our infrastructure, including on DuckDuckGo Search. We use JavaScript to fetch organic results, and that code is hosted on a dedicated subdomain – links.duckduckgo.com – using end-to-end encryption (TLS). This process is anonymous.
