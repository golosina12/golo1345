## What payment methods are accepted for Privacy Pro?

If you purchase Privacy Pro from our website, or from a DuckDuckGo browser downloaded from our website, we use Stripe as a payment processor. You can use a prepaid credit card to enhance your privacy when subscribing via Stripe, but only U.S. credit cards are accepted, as Privacy Pro is only available to U.S. residents.

If you purchase Privacy Pro from a DuckDuckGo browser downloaded from the Google Play Store or App Store, they handle the payments directly — accepting any payment method associated with your app store account. Their respective privacy policies and terms of service apply to payment processing.

## How do I manage my subscription, edit my payment method, or cancel it?

Where you can manage or change your subscription or payment method depends on the platform on which you subscribe:

-   If you subscribed via the App Store, you can manage your subscription and payment method in the App Store on an Apple device signed into your Apple account. Open the **Settings** app, search for **Subscriptions**, and then click **Privacy Pro**.
-   If you subscribed via Google Play Store, you can manage your subscription and payment method in the Google Play Store on an Android device signed into your Google account. Open the **Google Play** app, tap your profile picture, tap **Payments and Subscriptions**, then tap **Subscriptions**, then tap **Privacy Pro**.
-   If you subscribed via our website or the DuckDuckGo browser downloaded from our website, you can manage your subscription and payment method on desktop, under **Manage Subscription** > **Change Plan or Billing**. On mobile, tap **Subscription Settings** > **Change Plan or Billing**.

## How do I check when my subscription expires?

Your subscription will auto-renew monthly or annually, depending on the payment terms selected, until canceled. The renewal or expiration date (if you’ve canceled) is available in the Privacy Pro settings section within the DuckDuckGo browser.
