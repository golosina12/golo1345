DuckDuckGo VPN uses the fast and secure WireGuard protocol. Learn more about Wireguard [here](https://www.wireguard.com/).

## Why WireGuard?

WireGuard is a fast, secure, open-source VPN protocol with state-of-the-art cryptography. It's designed to be simpler and faster than other commonly used VPN protocols.

## Does the VPN support TCP or IPv6 traffic?

Our VPN doesnâ€™t currently support TCP or IPv6 traffic, but we do plan to do so in the future.

## Does the VPN work with Apple's iCloud Private Relay?

No. Traffic that goes through DuckDuckGo VPN will not use iCloud Private Relay.

## Can I configure the VPN myself or do I have to use the DuckDuckGo browser?

The DuckDuckGo browser is required to use the VPN, but once enabled it works across all apps on your device.

We do not provide configuration files for other VPN clients.
