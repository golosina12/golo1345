## Do I need the DuckDuckGo browser to use Privacy Pro?

Yes. All Privacy Pro features are set up and accessed through the DuckDuckGo browser.

The DuckDuckGo browser lets you search and browse privately, with more than [a dozen privacy features](https://duckduckgo.com/compare-privacy) in one convenient package, all for free. By adding a Privacy Pro subscription, you can encrypt Internet connections across your entire device (even outside the browser) with our VPN; limit the visibility of your personal info online and data brokers’ access to it with Personal Information Removal on Mac or Windows; and, with Identity Theft Restoration, we can help get you back on track should you become a victim of identity theft.
